The Mana Calculator Server project is the Spring Boot backend for the Spell Forge: Aetherian Realm Spell Management web application. The Spell Forge allows the players in the Dungeons and Dragons game, The Aetherian Realm: Legacy of Destiny, to easily create and manage custom spells.

This backend server connects to a MySQL database which contains all of the spell attributes and user-created spells and spell casters.
